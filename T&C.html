        MockWiz up-to-date. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services after we have posted a
        modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are
        indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you,
        your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services.</p>
      <h4>Eligibility</h4>
      <p>The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are aged 16 or older. Any access to or
        use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 16 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the
        Site, Application or Services you represent and warrant that (i) you agree to be bound by these Terms and (ii)
        that you are 16 or older and able to form legally binding contracts. However, if law requires that you must be
        older in order for MockWiz to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of
        your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>
      <h4>How the Site, Application and Services Work</h4>
      <p>The Site is a platform for Members to connect and schedule Appointments in order to exchange information with
        other Members. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however,
        if you wish to use the Services or post a Listing, you must provide your contact information and other
        information the meeting request form deems mandatory.</p>
      <p>MockWiz’s role is solely to facilitate the availability of the Site, Application and Services and to provide
        services related thereto, such as Appointment scheduling, call queuing, call cycling, payment integration and
        call facilitation. MockWiz does not provide and is not responsible for Member Content or any information or
        advice exchanged between Members during Appointments or otherwise. MockWiz does not verify the credentials of
        any of its Members. You understand and acknowledge that Experts are not employees or agents of MockWiz but are
        independent service providers using the Site, Application and Services to market their expertise to other
        Members and the public. You acknowledge that MockWiz will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by your
        reliance on information provided by Members or information contained in Member Content.</p>
      <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE
        MEMBER INTERACTION. MOCKWIZ CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL OR GUARANTEE THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS OR
        THE INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN MEMBERS VIA THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MOCKWIZ IS NOT
        RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED
        UNDER THE SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, ALL MEMBERS USE THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES AT THEIR OWN RISK.</p>

      <h4>Listings</h4>
      <p>You (as a Service Provider or Expert) may create Listings to offer your services to other Members. To this end,
        you may need to provide information regarding the expertise you offer as well as pricing and other financial
        terms applicable to your offering. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and
        Services. MockWiz reserves the right to make any changes to the listings, with your consent.</p>
      <p>Seekers will be able to schedule an Appointment with you via the Site, Application and Services based upon the
        information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Seeker requests an Appointment, the
        price quoted under your Listing may not be altered.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you
        represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the agreements you enter into with Seekers (i) will not
        breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) comply with all applicable
        laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to you and (b) not conflict with the rights of
        third parties. Please note that MockWiz assumes no responsibility for the content of Listings or for any
        Member’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>You understand and agree that MockWiz is not involved in the interactions between Members and does not refer or
        endorse or recommend particular Experts to Seekers. You also understand and acknowledge that MockWiz does not
        edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee Member Content or the content of communications
        between Members. As stated above, MockWiz is not party to any agreements entered into between Members.</p>
      <p>MockWiz reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing
        for any reason, including Listings that MockWiz, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any
        reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services. You acknowledge
        and agree that, as an Expert, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.</p>

      <h4>No Endorsement</h4>
      <p>As stated above, MockWiz does not endorse any of its Members. In addition, although these Terms require Members
        to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported
        identity or credentials. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you
        contact via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
      <p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to
        obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the
        particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability
        on, or seek any legal remedy from MockWiz with respect to such actions or omissions.</p>


      <h4>Appointments and Financial Terms</h4>
      <p>Appointments and Financial Terms for Experts: When you confirm an Appointment request, MockWiz will send you an
        email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make
        via the Site, Application and Services.</p>

      <p>The amount due and payable by a Seeker relating to Appointment time with you is referred to as an “Appointment
        Fee”. Appointment Fees are quoted in each Listing, in CAD dollars per 30-minute sesssions. Please note that both
        Experts and MockWiz have the right to set the Appointment Fee.</p>
      <p>In consideration of the Services, MockWiz charges a fee (the “Service Fee”) to the Seeker. The Service Fee is
        deducted from the Appointment Fee payable to the Service Provider. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service
        Fees are non-refundable.
        MockWiz does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.</p>

      <h4>Appointments and Financial Terms for Seekers</h4>
      <p>You (as a Seeker), not MockWiz, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Appointments. If you choose
        to enter into a transaction with an Expert by scheduling an Appointment via the Site or Application, these Terms
        and other terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Appointment as set out in the Listing
        may apply. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not MockWiz, will be responsible for performing the
        obligations of any such agreements, and MockWiz is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability
        arising from or related to any such agreements.</p>
      <p>You agree to pay MockWiz the Appointment Fee due in connection with any Appointment. In order to initiate an
        Appointment, you understand and agree that MockWiz reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain a
        pre-authorization of your credit card or charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed five Canadian
        dollar ($5 CAD), in order to verify your credit card. Please note that MockWiz cannot control any fees that may
        be charged to a Member by his or her bank related to MockWiz’s collection of the Appointment Fees, and MockWiz
        disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
      <p>In connection with your payment, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name,
        billing address and credit card information either to MockWiz or its third-party payment processor. You agree to
        pay MockWiz for any consummated Appointments in accordance with these Terms, by one of the methods described on
        the Site or Application. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card
        provided as part of requesting the Appointment, either directly by MockWiz or indirectly, via a third-party
        online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. If you are
        directed to MockWiz’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of
        that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such
        terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your transaction is complete you will
        receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Appointment.</p>

      <h4>Appointments and Financial Terms for Service Providers</h4>
      <p>You (as a Service Provider), not MockWiz, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Appointments. If
        you choose to enter into a transaction with a Seeker by scheduling an Appointment via the Site or Application,
        these Terms and other terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Appointment as set out in
        the Listing may apply. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not MockWiz, will be responsible for performing
        the obligations of any such agreements, and MockWiz is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all
        liability arising from or related to any such agreements.</p>
      <p>You agree to pay MockWiz the Service Fee due in connection with any Appointment. Please note that MockWiz
        cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Member by his or her bank related to MockWiz’s collection or
        deposit of the Appointment Fees, and MockWiz disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
      <p>To facilitate payment into your bank accounts, you will be asked to provide customary information such as name,
        address and your bank account information either to MockWiz or its third-party payment processor. Payments will
        be made monthly into your bank account, subject to a minimum payment of $100 CAD. You agree to pay MockWiz for
        any consummated Appointments in accordance with these Terms, by one of the methods described on the Site or
        Application. If you are directed to MockWiz’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and
        conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection
        practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your
        transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Appointment.</p>

      <h4>General Financial Terms</h4>
      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      <p>You (as a Seeker or Expert) may cancel an Appointment without penalty; provided, however, that you provide a
        notice up to 7 days before the scheduled session. If you have been improperly charged for an Appointment that
        was cancelled and require a refund, please contact us at hello@Mockwiz.com.</p>

        Application and Services (“Feedback”). You may submit Feedback by emailing us at hello@Mockwiz.com. You
        acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of MockWiz and you hereby

        in
        and to all Feedback, including without limitation all worldwide patent, copyright, trade secret, moral and other
        proprietary or intellectual property rights therein. At MockWiz’s request and expense, you will execute

        its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the Feedback.</p>

      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without MockWiz’s prior written
        consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no
        effect. MockWiz may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the
        foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted
        assigns.
      </p>

      <h4>Notices</h4>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified herein, any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder,
        including
        those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by MockWiz (i) via email (in each
        case
        to the email address that you provide for Account creation) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the
        Application.
        For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

      <h4>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
      <p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and Canada, without
        regard
        to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court
        located in Calgary, Alberta for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other
        equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
        property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</p>

      <h4>Severability</h4>
      <p>These Terms are intended to govern the agreement between MockWiz and you to the extent permitted by all
        applicable
        laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any
        person
        or circumstances shall, for any reason or to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these
        Terms
        and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but
        rather
        shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

      <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
      <p>You and MockWiz agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
        breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of
        the
        Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration , except that each party
        retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent
        the
        actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
        secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and MockWiz are each
        waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
        action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and MockWiz otherwise agree in writing, the
        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
        class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this
        “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute
        Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

      <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between MockWiz and you regarding
        the
        Site, Application, Services, Collective Content and any Appointments or Listings made via the Site, Application
        and Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or
        agreements
        between MockWiz and you regarding the same.</p>

      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>The failure of MockWiz to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future
        enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in
        writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of MockWiz. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms,
        the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
        remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction
        finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
        extent
        permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

      <h4>The Collection of Information</h4>
      <p>Our principal goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services,
        features
        and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (collectively, the “Service”) and to enable
        users
        to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application. The types of information that we collect include:</p>
      <p>Information you provide to us</p>
      <p>Personal Information: You may browse the Site and Application without providing any personal information that
        may
        be used to identify you personally. However, when you request a session or meeting, access certain content or
        features, or directly contact the Site or Application, we may ask you to provide information, including:</p>

      <p>(collectively, “Personal Information”)</p>
      <p>Information automatically collected - When you visit and interact on the Site or Application, certain
        information is collected automatically, including:</p>
      <p>Non-Identifying Information: We collect other non-identifying information you provide as part of the
        registration,
        administration and personalization of your MockWiz Account profile (e.g. account preferences) (“Non-Identifying
        Information”). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with
        information collected from other MockWiz Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better
        experience,
        to improve the quality and value of the Site, Application and Service and to analyze and understand how our
        Site,
        Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you
        specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>
      <p>Log Data: When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user (any of these,
        a
        “MockWiz User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a
        website
        (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
        browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and
        Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and
        Application,
        access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site,
        Application and the Service and for the Site and Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site
        and
        Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our
        visitors’
        needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal
        Information,
        though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding
        other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
      <p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we
        transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we
        utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second,
        we utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you
        interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by MockWiz Users and web traffic routing
        on
        the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log
        off from the Site or Application and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its
        options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If
        you
        do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all
        functionality of the Service.</p>
      <p>Web Beacons: Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called
        single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and
        Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been
        opened
        by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our Member communications and marketing campaigns.

      <p>If you register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or Application, we will obtain the Personal
        Information you have provided to the applicable TPSP (such as your true name, email address, profile picture,
        names of TPSP friends, names of TPSP groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available
        via
        the applicable TPSP and/or other information you authorize MockWiz to access by authorizing the TPSP to provide
        such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your MockWiz Account and
        MockWiz Account profile page. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy
        settings
        that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party
        Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the TPSP and authorized by
        you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your MockWiz Account on
        the Site, Service and Application. If there is information about your “friends” or people with whom you are
        associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those “friends” or people with whom you
        are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable TPSP.

          including maintenance services, database management, web analytics, data processing and email and text message

      <h4>Third Party Services</h4>
      <p>To customize your experience on the Site and Application and to simplify our registration process, we provide
        you
        with the opportunity to access or interact with TPSPs, such as Google, Calnedly, Zoom, Facebook, Twitter and
        LinkedIn. When you connect to the Site or Application through these TPSPs, we may share information about you
        with
        these third-party service providers and they may share data about you with us.</p>
      <p>When you allow us to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site account, we may use this
        data
        for several purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating relationships automatically within our system. For example, if you connect to us via a service with a
            public friend list, like Twitter, we may check to see if any people you follow on Twitter are also Site members.
            If web find a match, we will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans,
            followers, or friends on our Site.</li>
          <li>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send service-specific messages. For example, we may use
            friend lists from a TPSP to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to share your MockWiz Account
            profile
            page.</li>
          <li>To enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>When you are connected via a TPSP, we may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, in
        order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site. MockWiz also used certain third party platforms
        and
        services to store your information.</p>

      <p>Please remember that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party services. We encourage you to
        read the privacy policies of all TPSP websites.</p>

      <h4>Updating and Deleting your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by
        contacting us at hello@Mockwiz.com or editing their profile. If you would like us to deactivate your MockWiz
        Account, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal
        obligation
        or a legitimate business reason to retain the information contained in your MockWiz Account. Please note that,
        if
        you cancel your MockWiz Account, any of your Member Content on the Site and Application will remain publicly
        viewable via the Site and Application. Please see below for privacy contact information.
      </p>

      <h4>Security and Data Retention</h4>
      <p>To protect your privacy and information, MockWiz uses multiple security procedures and practices to protect
        from
        unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure of Personal Information of users.</p>
      <p>When you enter Personal Information on our Site and Application, we encrypt that information using secure
        socket
        layer technology (SSL). SSL creates a secured connection between our web servers and your browser, which
        protects
        against unauthorized access to transmitted data and supports data being sent only to intended recipients.</p>
      <p>Your Personal Information is password protected and our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading
        provider
        of Internet access to enterprises with mission-critical Internet application requirements. Access to the host
        environment is secure.</p>
      <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to MockWiz. Safeguarding
        information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time,
        request your credit card information, your MockWiz Account ID, login password, or national identification
        numbers
        in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.</p>
      <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both
        during
        transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic
        storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
        security on our Site and Application, you can contact us at hello@Mockwiz.com.</p>
      <p>Note that we will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or
        integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on
        security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site and Application in the most
        expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with</p>
        <div class="sub">
          <ul>
          <li>the legitimate needs of law enforcement or</li>
          <li>any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the
          data system.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        These laws may not be equivalent to the privacy and data protection laws in your jurisdiction. Information may
